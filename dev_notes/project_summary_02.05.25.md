## Rover Project Progress Summary

### Project Goal
Build an autonomous rover using a Raspberry Pi, with modular code for motor control, web interface, mapping, and vision.

---

### Current Architecture & Structure

- **rover/**
  - **core/**: Fundamental logic (e.g., `motor_controller.py`)
  - **utils/**: Utilities (e.g., `gpio_mock.py` for mock GPIO)
  - **web/**: (Planned) Flask web interface for manual control
  - **mapping/**, **vision/**: (Planned) For navigation and camera features
  - **tests/**: Test scripts (e.g., `test_motor_controller.py`)

---

### What’s Implemented

- **GPIO Mock (`gpio_mock.py`)**:  
  - Provides a mock GPIO interface for development/testing on non-Raspberry Pi systems.
  - Tracks pin states and prints actions for debugging.

- **Motor Controller (`motor_controller.py`)**:  
  - Controls left/right motors (forward, backward, left, right, stop).
  - Uses the GPIO controller (real or mock) for pin operations.

- **Test Script (`test_motor_controller.py`)**:  
  - Runs through all movement commands and prints pin states.
  - Confirms that the motor controller and GPIO mock work as expected.

- **Virtual Environment**:  
  - All dependencies (e.g., `gpiozero`) are installed in a virtual environment (`rover-env`).

---

### Next Steps

1. **Build the Web Interface**:  
   - Use Flask to create a browser-based control panel for the rover.

2. **(Optional) Add More Core Features**:  
   - Sensor interfaces, navigation, safety features.

3. **Self-Study Task**:  
   - (Suggested) Add a “move forward for X seconds” method to the motor controller and test it.

---

### How to Run Tests

- Activate your virtual environment:
  ```sh
  source /path/to/rover-env/bin/activate
  ```
- Run the test:
  ```sh
  python3 -m rover.tests.test_motor_controller
  ```

### How to Save Chat/Notes

- Copy this summary and any important chat to a file (e.g., `rover_chat_notes.md`) in your project directory.

**Tip:**  
When you return, you can paste this summary into the chat to quickly bring the assistant up to speed!
